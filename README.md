Documentation and Notes
Background
theZoo's objective is to offer a fast and easy way of retrieving malware samples and source code in an organized fashion in hopes of promoting malware research.

Root Files
Since version 0.42 theZoo has been undergoing dramatic changes. It now runs in both CLI and ARGVS modes. You can call the program with the same command line arguments as before. The current default state of theZoo runtime is the CLI. The following files and directories are responsible for the application's behaviour.

/conf - The conf folder holds files relevant to the particular running of the program but are not part of the application. You can find the EULA file in the conf and more.

/imports - Contains .py import files used by the rest of the application

/malwares/Binaries - The actual malwares samples - be careful! These are very live.

/malware/Source - Malware source code.

Malware under the folder Original is supposed to be (NO PROMISES!) the original source of the malware that leaked. Malware under the folder Reversed is either reversed, decompiled or partially reconstructed.

Directory Structure:
Each directory is composed of 4 files:

Malware files in an encrypted ZIP archive.
SHA256 sum of the 1st file.
MD5 sum of the 1st file.
Password file for the archive.
Bugs and Reports
The repository holding all files is currently https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo

Submit Malware
Get the file you want to submit and just run python prep_file.py file_tosubmit.exe. It will create a directory for you. Then just submit that along with the changes to the conf/maldb.db so that we know which malware it is.
